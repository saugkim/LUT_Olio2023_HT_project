Applicaiton for Android 

Title: Flowers in my yard

Test device: Mobile phone (Motorola)

Tools: Android studio 
Language: JAVA

Goal: Take photo of flowers and save them through the app. Ultimate goal is collecting images of flowers-nearby- as many as possible with different daytime(morning, eveing, night), weather(rain, sunny, cloud...), state of flowers (bud, blooming -begin, ending).

Purpose of collecting images is for the train some model of image recognition of flowers with deep learning tools for education or leasure purpose. This app is not meant for train model itself, just for collecting my own flower images dataset using this app, which helps image pre-processing (files of same size and format, labeling for classification). When taking photos, location information (longitude and latitude) will be saved, this is to take more photos of same flower if needed (get more samples).
